<h1> Distortion Quant Model for Brazilian Stocks</h1>

This quant model was developed by me in 2020.  The code by itself is not pretty, as it was developed just for me, but the purpose is very useful.
The Distortions model tries to predict whether a <strong>Brazilian stock will go up or down in the next 21 days</strong>. I've been using it since the day I developed and have made great profits from it.
